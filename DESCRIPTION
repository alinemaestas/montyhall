Description: The game setup replicates the game on the TV show "Let's
	Make a Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant
	to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and two 
	have goats. The contestant selects a door, then the host
	opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is
	given an opportunity to change doors. The contestant wins when they open a door with a car.
